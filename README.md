# Backups

I finally have a dedicated hard drive for storing backups so I wrote some
scripts to help me create and restore archives:

- `backup`: for making backups of various partitions.
- `restore`: for restoring data to partitions.

## Setting up cron job

Run `sudo make install` or `sudo make`. `sudo` is required because it adds a
cronjob to the end of the root user's crontab. The job will back up the `/` and
`/home` partitions every other day at 01:00am.

## Restoring Data

The process is outlined [in this walkthrough](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BackupYourSystem/TAR)
but if that link should die someday here are the basic steps.

1. Run Ubuntu from a pen drive.
2. Partition target drive, minimum of two (`/` and `/home`).
3. Format partitions with ext4 fs.
4. Mount paritions and `backups` drive.
5. Update the `/etc/fstab` file in the `root` patition with the new UUIDs.
6. Use `restore.sh` to restore data to the various paritions, check `restore.sh
--help` for more information.
7. For the `root` drive run `restore.sh grub` to restore grub (duh).
8. If that fails then boot from the pen drive again and run the following comman
d to try fixing the boot process on the drive and follow the instructions spat
out by the `boot-repair` program:

```bash
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install boot-repair -y
boot-repair
```

9. If, on the off chance, you get stuck on the `grub` menu:
   1. run `ls` to see devices.
   2. run `ls <dev>/` to find the root partition.
   3. run `set root=<dev>` to set the root partition.
   4. run `linux /boot/vmlinuz-<linux-kernel-version>`
   5. run `initrd /initrd.img-<linux-kernel-version>`
   6. run `boot`
